Upload all codes and used data files to Git Hub.\
Data3 folder is for all old codes that might contain some useful tools. Should not be looked at unless nothing can be found in thesis folder (probably won't be found in this folder either).\
MLP folder needs to be run under Windows system or any system that can run both python and Excel.\
Thesis folder contains codes that are newer.\

Cleaner text result files will be added to the newest result folder.\
Some data for integrated yield do not have systematic uncertainties because the original data does not have them.\
The order of p1~pn files can be found in the plotting micros within the same folder. Generally, it's of the order of system size from large to small, and year new to old.\
